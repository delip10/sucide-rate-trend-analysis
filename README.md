# sucide_rate_trend_analysis
Suicide rates have been observed to skyrocket over the past few decades. There can be many reasons contributing to these suicides. This project is an attempt to understand parameters which contribute to suicide and predicted. Machine learning algorithms is used to predict the suicide. Exploratory data analysis is to be performed to understand which of the given parameters result in a suicide and neglect others. The machine learning model will run on training set and will be tested against test set. In this dataset, parameters are country, year, sex, age, number of suicides, population country HDI of for history for year, GDP for year and GDP per capita and generation.
